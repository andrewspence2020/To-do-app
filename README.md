Objective:
 My objective with this project was to make a To-do List application that I could use to log my everyday activities. I have used this project for personal use.

What I enjoyed most about making this project:
What I enjoyed most about making this project was that as soon I learned Java and I was able to utilize those skills and display them in this project. It was also my first time using Jsp and Java Servlets so it was very exciting to learn these new Skills then apply them to my project.

What i didn’t enjoy the most about this project:
 Getting the MySQL Workbench to sync with my project was a pain. I had to delete and reinstall MySQL database 8 times for the thing to work which I think now I didn't have to.
Getting Tomcat to work with eclipse was a pain. Getting the latest to work wasn’t easy.
